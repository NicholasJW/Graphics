Graphics Project2
Name: Nicholas Wan

For linux users, you can use the world.config file and corresponding obj files or you can specify your own. To add configurations, just follow the syntax with five entries for each object (FilePath, color, translation, scale, totation). 

To compile the project just enter 'make' from your terminal. To run the project, enter 'make start' after compilation for the default configuration. For your own config files, enter './mav [config_file_path]'.
